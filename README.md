# HACK-THE-BLOCK

Introduction

As online marketplaces and decentralized platforms expand, the need for a fair, transparent, and efficient dispute resolution system becomes essential to build user trust. The global nature of interactions requires solutions that are impartial, scalable, and cost-effective.


Blockchain-based dispute resolution offers a compelling solution, where jurors are selected through a decentralized process utilizing a native token like GRULL. Jurors must stake tokens to participate, and their chances of being selected rise with the number of tokens they stake, ensuring that only active and engaged members are chosen. This model promotes fair decision-making and discourages manipulation or malicious behavior. Nevertheless, challenges such as Sybil attacks, token hoarding, and misaligned incentives can threaten the system's integrity.


The challenge is to address these potential risks while optimizing the dispute resolution mechanism to ensure a secure, fair, and decentralized process. Inspired by Schelling points in game theory—where individuals converge on a common solution without direct communication—we propose a system that encourages jurors to act truthfully, assuming that others will do the same, thus fostering a shared expectation of honesty.


This project aims to design a blockchain-based dispute resolution system that utilizes decentralized juror selection through GRULL tokens. The objective is to build a system that is secure, equitable, resistant to manipulation, and incentivizes jurors to vote honestly. Key challenges to be addressed include:

1. Juror Selection and Token Staking: Develop a juror selection mechanism that ensures only engaged jurors who have staked tokens are chosen. Prevent large token holders from monopolizing the selection process while maintaining fairness. Implement measures to safeguard the system from Sybil attacks, where bad actors attempt to create multiple juror identities to influence outcomes.

2. Attack Resistance: Preventing Token Accumulation: Create a dynamic pricing model for tokens that makes it financially difficult for any single entity to accumulate a disproportionate number of tokens. Use a weighted random selection process for jurors, with diminishing returns after a certain threshold, ensuring smaller token holders still have a chance of being selected. Introduce randomized juror pools to prevent concentrated control and influence over decisions.

3. Incentive Alignment: Honest Voting: Establish penalties for jurors who vote dishonestly, redistributing their tokens to those who vote in line with the majority. Provide rewards to majority voters not only through arbitration fees but also from the tokens of dishonest voters, incentivizing fair and thoughtful decisions.

# The tasks our team has done:

1. Develop the Juror Selection Process:

Implement a decentralized, token-based juror selection process where jurors self-select by staking GRULL tokens, and selection probability is proportional to tokens staked.
Ensure fairness by preventing token monopolization and reducing Sybil attack risks.

2. Create a Dynamic Token Pricing System:

Build a model where token prices increase as demand rises, discouraging any single entity from accumulating too many tokens and manipulating the system.

3. Implement a Voting Incentive System:

Design a mechanism where jurors are incentivized to vote honestly through penalties for dishonest voting and rewards for aligning with the majority decision.
This system should foster trust by making dispute resolution decentralized, transparent, and difficult to manipulate.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
