# HACK-THE-BLOCK

Introduction

As online marketplaces and decentralized platforms grow, a fair, transparent, and efficient
dispute resolution system is crucial to fostering trust among users.The increasing complexity of
global interactions calls for solutions that are not only impartial but also cost-effective and
scalable.

Blockchain-based dispute resolution offers a promising alternative, where jurors are selected
through a decentralized process using a native token, such as the GRULL token. Jurors stake
tokens to participate, and their chance of being selected increases with the amount of tokens
they stake, ensuring that only active and engaged participants are chosen. This system
incentivizes fair and honest decision-making while protecting against manipulation or malicious
behavior. However, despite the benefits, challenges like Sybil attacks, token accumulation,
and incentive misalignment can compromise the system’s integrity.

In this challenge, we are tasked with addressing these potential threats and optimizing
the dispute resolution mechanism to ensure a secure, fair, and decentralized process.
Drawing from the concept of Schelling points in game theory—where individuals gravitate
towards a natural consensus without communication—we introduce a decentralized dispute
resolution system. This system incentivizes participants to act truthfully, assuming others will do
the same, creating a mutual expectation of honesty.

The project involves designing a blockchain-based dispute resolution system that relies on decentralized juror selection using GRULL tokens. The goal is to create a system that is secure, fair, and resistant to attacks or manipulation while incentivizing honest decision-making from jurors. Key challenges your project must address include:

1. Juror Selection and Token Staking:

Design an efficient juror selection mechanism that ensures active engagement by considering only jurors who have staked tokens.
Prevent monopolization by large token holders, balancing selection probability while maintaining fairness.
Protect the system against Sybil attacks by ensuring that bad actors cannot easily create multiple juror accounts to manipulate outcomes.

2. Attack Resistance: Preventing Token Accumulation:

Implement a dynamic token pricing model to make token accumulation by one entity financially unviable.
Ensure weighted random selection of jurors based on staked tokens, with diminishing returns beyond a certain threshold, so smaller token holders still have a chance.
Introduce randomized juror pools to prevent any single party from controlling multiple pools and influencing the results.

3. Incentive Alignment: Honest Voting:

Create a system of penalties for jurors who vote dishonestly (i.e., votes that don't align with the majority decision), redistributing their tokens to honest jurors.
Reward majority jurors not only with arbitration fees but also with tokens taken from dishonest voters, incentivizing fair and reasoned decisions.

# The tasks our team has done:

1. Develop the Juror Selection Process:

Implement a decentralized, token-based juror selection process where jurors self-select by staking GRULL tokens, and selection probability is proportional to tokens staked.
Ensure fairness by preventing token monopolization and reducing Sybil attack risks.

2. Create a Dynamic Token Pricing System:

Build a model where token prices increase as demand rises, discouraging any single entity from accumulating too many tokens and manipulating the system.

3. Implement a Voting Incentive System:

Design a mechanism where jurors are incentivized to vote honestly through penalties for dishonest voting and rewards for aligning with the majority decision.
This system should foster trust by making dispute resolution decentralized, transparent, and difficult to manipulate.
